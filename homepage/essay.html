          <h1><FONT COLOR=#d6c7c7>The Only Light Visible in Darkness</FONT></h1>
          <p><FONT COLOR=#d6c7c7>My father was born in El Salvador in 1964, a third world country that’s people and government were controlled by cartels and corruption. My father told me a few things about his life in El Salvador. He lived with his grandparents since his parents didn't care for him, and he began working on their farm when he was 11 because schools were too expensive. He also told me about the tax, a tax that was imposed on anyone who owned a store or business that required them to give cartels a certain amount of money each month or else they would be executed. He’s told me about the war between the government and rebels who had enough with corruption. For him, it was a normal life: be home before sunset or risk being caught in crossfire or getting kidnapped, and in the mornings, leaving the house to go work once the ignition of powder could no longer be heard. The only life he could imagine could be better was in America.<br>
            He had heard many stories, the type of stories that almost everyone outside of America hears, “the streets are paved with gold,” “you can live the American dream,” “you can become rich and educated.” The belief that he could get a life where he could make hundreds of dollars rather than pennies, and that he could live in a place where he would not worry if his loved ones had survived the next day, was plenty enough to pay smugglers to be snuck into the US. His life in America began in the early 1980’s, knowing nothing about the country and with no knowledge of the language spoken. Luckily many immigrants had gone through the same situation as him, and spoke the same language as well. With enough time he began to understand things, slowly understand English, and he took many jobs, going to different states, and eventually in the early 2000’s he ended up in New York.<br>
            New York is where he decided to settle down. While he lived in Washington Heights, he bought a restaurant in 2003, called “Mi Paso,” in English “My Step,” where he served Salvadorian food. I don't have much memory of it since I was born in 2005, and he sold the restaurant in 2011; the only memories I have of it are sitting there sometimes after school and eating tamales. I definitely remember the area surrounding it, a wide street, surrounded with stores of all types, and right in front of the restaurant was a plaza. It was in between a massive cinema and a “Bravo” supermarket.<br>
            This plaza was a mysterious place. I only recently learned the name, it's called “Plaza de Las Americas.” There are no signs that indicate the name of the place, the only way you could know is if someone told you or if you looked on Google Maps, which I in fact did. The area has a very modern and advanced look to it, so much so that it makes the surrounding area look like a barren wasteland. In Washington Heights, every block has roughly done concrete work on the sidewalk, there is no public seating, except for the occasional bus stops that have crap smeared on its seats and dull shades of brown on every building. The plaza in between the supermarket and cinema is the one place that has concrete with symmetrical joints and a bright shade of gray, with metal seats that are always clean and shiny, and that random toilet that looks like a piece of technological modern art because of the pitch black panes of glass that form a perfect cube without edges. To describe the plaza as a metaphor, the Washington Heights area is a pitch black wall, and somewhere in the middle of this wall exists a white circle without impurities, which is the plaza.<br>
            The first memory I have of this place is when I was six years old. At the time the reason I went was because there was a farmers market there and my parents wanted to go and get stuff. I remember the smell of fresh vegetables, the spacious line of stalls with different vegetables, the dirt still attached to the vegetables, the brightness of the vegetables as the sun shone on its almost reflective body, the large number of people there and the amount of noise they produced. I recall being very curious about the various fruits and vegetables that were brought to the place and especially fascinated by the hand made soap that had fun designs. I remember asking my dad if I could buy the honey bar of soap that had a toy bee inside, after a bit of begging he purchased it for me. As a kid I hated showering but that purchase made me excited to bathe that day, then after that I most likely lost interest and went back to hating showers.<br>
            I recall this event so well because it was the last time I did something together with both my mother and father, because shortly after they split from each other. The last time I went to the plaza purposefully was a few months ago during summer. I visited randomly because I always take a path that crosses the plaza in order to exercise, and one day when I went running, the weekly farmers market was there, and I decided to check it out. Upon stepping foot into the place I searched for the smell I recognized, it was nowhere to be found. The market now has become a disorganized place that became less of a farmers market and more of a place where street vendors set up. Here I found people selling produce, old clothes, electronics, toys, and other gimmicks. The whole place was under multiple cramped tents, enough tents to block out the sun and hide the radiance of the vegetables and various goods. The place was like a maze, with only very few exits, and multiple thin paths that led to stalls upon stalls. The place was filled to the brim with buyers and sellers, making it hard to move around. I left after a few minutes since I wasn't looking for anything in particular. At the time I visited for no particular reason, the memory of me with my parents when I was six hadn't even come up in my mind; I had just thought of it when I was thinking about the plaza.<br>
              I believe the reason that people come to this area frequently to use it as a social hub, and use it as a farmers market is because people enjoy the look of the place. Washington Heights is a poor neighborhood, and clearly not enough tax money is put into creating public displays or areas. I think that other New Yorkers and I enjoy the plaza because it's special and one of the only places that is similar to the environment of upper class neighborhoods. In the plaza it's difficult to find signs of poverty, especially since drug dealers stay away from this place. When drugs are distributed in almost every street, you can see why this place is so meaningful to many of the residents here. Passing by, I always see every seat taken by people; they eat, talk, read the news, or just scroll through their phones. The Plaza is a light that illuminates the darkness, not to reveal what is inside, but to show people a safe haven that is untainted by its surroundings. This place is meaningful to the Heights community because in richer neighborhoods, the wall is filled with impure white, with few black circles. The plaza is one of the few white circles that “illuminate” the dark wall that is Washington Heights.<br></FONT>
